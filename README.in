General Information
===================

This is libusb-win32 version @VERSION@. Libusb-win32 is a library which allows
userspace application access to USB devices on Windows operation systems 
(Win98, WinMe, Win2k, WinXP). 
It is derived from and fully API compatible to libusb available at 
http://libusb.sourceforge.net.

The official ftp site is:
  ftp://ftp.libusb-win32.sourceforge.net/pub/libusb/

The official web site is:
  http://libusb-win32.sourceforge.net/

The official project site is:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb-win32


The package consists of the following components:

* An USB class filter driver (libusbfl.sys) which allows access to all 
  installed USB devices except root hubs and host controllers.

* An USB device driver stub (libusbst.sys) which does, as the name indicates,
  nothing really interresting. The only purpose of this driver is to install
  USB devices for which no vendor or system driver excists 
  (self build/developed USB hardware,etc.). All communication with these 
  devices is done through the filter driver. 

* Two inf-files to install the above drivers.

* A user space library to access the filter driver. 


Copying
=======

* The DLL is distributed under the LGPL. See file COPYING_LGPL.txt for details.

* The drivers are distributed under the GPL. See file COPYING_GPL.txt for 
  details.


Building
========

* Requirements

   - Win2k or XP system.
   - The XP-DDK to build the drivers and import library for Microsoft 
     compilers.
   - MinGW/Msys (http://www.mingw.org), Cygwin is not working yet.
   - Borland C++ to build the import library for this compiler 
     (optional). A free command line version of BCC can be downloaded from 
     http://www.borland.com. Make sure, that the compilers binary 
     directory is in the systems search path. 
     

* Build process

  The package is currently build with a standard Makefile, no autoconf/automake
  scripts are available yet.

   - From an Msys shell run the following commands (replace 'DDKDIR' with 
     your DDK's root directory): 
     'make DDK_PATH=c:/DDKDIR' to build the DLL, inf-files and 'free'
     versions of the drivers, or
     'make DDK_PATH=c:/DDKDIR DDK_BUILD_CHECKED=1' to build the same as above
     but 'checked' versions of the drivers. These 'checked' versions produce 
     useful debug messages at runtime, which can be captured using 'DebugView'
     available from http://www.sysinternals.com.
   - To build the distribution archives use 'make dist'. The options
     'BUILD_BCC_LIB=1' and/or 'BUILD_MSVC_LIB=1' can be added to build and
     include import libraries for Borland and/or Microsoft compilers.


Installation
============

* Installation of the filter driver
 
   - Build the package as described above, or download a binary package from
     the project site.
   - Extract the packege to a temporary directory
   - Right click on the file 'libusb_fl.inf'. From the appearing popup menu 
     choose "Install" to install the driver and it's DLL. On Win2k and WinXP 
     systems Windows will warn you, that the driver is not 'digitally signed'.
     Ignore this stupid message and continue the installation.
   - REBOOT YOUR SYSTEM TO MAKE THE DRIVER WORK!
   - Test the installation by running the supplied test programm 
     'testlibusb.exe' from a console window (Msys, Cygwin, cmd, command).
     If everything works, the program should print out the USB descriptors of 
     all USB devices connected to the system (USB host controllers and root 
     hubs are excluded from that list).

* Installation of the stub driver (optional)

   - Install the filter driver as described above.
   - Rename and edit the sample inf-file 'libusb_sa.inf', so that it fits your
     device (modify the vendor and product IDs, strings, etc.). 
     Create different inf-files to install different types of devices (devices
     with different IDs).
   - Connect the device.
   - When Windows asks for a driver, choose the inf-file created above. On
     Win2k and WinXP systems Windows will warn you, that the driver is not 
     'digitally signed'. Ignore this stupid message and continue the 
     installation.
   - Open the Windows Device Manager to verify that the device is installed 
     correctly.
   - Run the test program as decribed above. The device should now be included
     in the list.

Usage
=====

For using this library in your own applications, the binary packages provide
prebuild import libraries for the most common compilers (GCC, BCC, MSVC).

IMPORTANT: To avoid any conflicts with future versions of libusb-win32:
	DO NOT INCLUDE THE DLL IN YOUR APPLICATION'S DIRECTORY! 
	The DLL is installed automaticaly by the driver's inf-files in 
	Windows' system folders!
