Version 0.1.8.1:

	- Driver/DLL: improved usb_control_msg(), added better support for
	  vendor and class specific requests.
	- Service: removed support for USB root hubs. This results in much 
	  faster initialization and much shorter startup times. 
	- Driver: fixed a bug in the bulk and interrupt functions which caused
	  a BSOD under some very rare conditions.
	- Improved installer/uninstaller speed.
	- Added Cygwin support. The whole package can now be build under 
	  Cygwin and the latest MSys/MinGW.


Version 0.1.8.0:
	
	- Ported version 0.1.8.0 of libusb to libusb-win32 
	- Filter driver: fixed two bugs which caused BSODs on some systems
	  during powerdown and device removal.
	- Filter driver: fixed bug in composite device handling code.
	- Services: added better handling of composite devices. These devices
	  now appear as one single device instead of multiple devices for
	  each interface.
	- Sample inf-file: renamed to libusb.inf.
	- Sample inf-file: added better support for composite devices
	- Sample inf-file: included direct support for the Dakota and Walgreens
	  digital cameras.
	- Installer: improved installation speed.


Version 0.1.7.10:

	- DLL: fixed bug which caused the device detection to fail on some 
	  systems.
	- Filter driver: PNP and power management code improved. This will 
	  hopefully remove the shutdown and hibernation problems reported by
	  some users an XP systems.
	- The binary package distributions has been split up into two parts:
	  Filter driver and device driver. An user friendly GUI installer has
	  been added for the filter driver. The device driver (stub driver)
	  doesn't need the filter driver to be installed any more.
	- Filter driver: the filter driver is now installed in a different way
	  which will now allow access to all USB devices which weren't
	  accessible in the past (mice, scanners, etc.). A Windows system 
	  service (daemon) has been added to achive this.

 
Version 0.1.7.9:

	- Filter driver: support for Composite Devices (devices with multiple
	  interfaces) improved.
	- DLL: added function usb_get_version() which returns the version of
	  the running driver and DLL.


Version 0.1.7.8:

	- DLL: removed a memory leak
	- DLL: fixed bug which caused the DLL to detect an invalid number
	  of root hubs on some systems which made some devices inaccessable.
	- DLL: errors are now also printed to the Windows debug system. They
	  can be captured using DebugView from http://www.sysinternals.com.
	- Filter driver: the driver now reflects the DLL's debug setting
	  (can be set using usb_set_debug()).
	  This makes the distribution of two different driver versions 
	  (checked/free build) unnecessary.
	  The following debug levels are supported:
	      0: no output
	      1: errors only
	      2: warnings and errors
	      3 and higher: warnings, errors, normal messages
	 - Inf files: updated, minor changes


Version 0.1.7.7:

	- Filter driver: some control transfers (vendor specific request)
	  failed or worked incorrectly, this bug has been fixed.
	- all drivers: a bug in the inf-files which prevented the drivers
	  to install on Win98 systems has been fixed.
	- Filter driver: parameter validation and error handling has been
	  improved.
	- Filter driver, DLL: the maximum number of supported devices has
	  been increased to 256.
	- DLL: under some circumstances the DLL didn't detect newly connected
	  devices correctly at runtime, this problem has been fixed.
	- The build system now uses the 'lib' utility from the DDK to build
          the import library for Microsoft compilers. Visual C++ isn't required
          any more.
